# Skill Manifest - Trigger Conditions for Automatic Skill Discovery
#
# Purpose: Structured lookup table for commands like /specify, /plan, and
# /implement to determine which skills are relevant for a given spec.
#
# Usage: When evaluating a spec, check each skill's triggers against the spec's
# frontmatter fields, keywords, and current phase. If any trigger matches,
# the skill should be consulted. Skills marked "always: true" apply universally.
#
# This file INFORMS skill selection -- it does not enforce it. AI judgment
# still applies, but this manifest ensures skills aren't overlooked due to
# gaps in frontmatter classification (e.g., Phase 5 accessibility gap).
#
# Schema version: 1.0
# Last updated: 2026-01-30

# =============================================================================
# ALWAYS-ACTIVE SKILLS
# These apply regardless of spec content or phase.
# =============================================================================

meta-skill-guide:
  description: Check skill registry before any task
  always: true
  phases: [specify, plan, tasks, implement, verify]
  note: Universal dispatcher -- ensures skills are considered on every turn

workflow-verify-complete:
  description: Evidence-based completion verification
  always: true
  phases: [implement, verify]
  note: Fires before any claim of "done", "passing", or "complete"

meta-context-optimize:
  description: Context window management patterns
  always: true
  phases: [specify, plan, tasks, implement, verify]
  note: Relevant when sessions run long (10+ tasks, 30+ minutes)

feature-capture-idea:
  description: Quick idea capture to future-work.md
  always: true
  phases: [specify, plan, tasks, implement, verify]
  note: Asynchronous -- fires when ideas arise during any work


# =============================================================================
# PHASE-GATE SKILLS
# These fire at specific phase transitions in the SpecKit pipeline.
# =============================================================================

spec-validate:
  description: Pre-planning spec completeness gate
  phases: [plan]
  triggers:
    phase_gate: specify -> plan
  note: MANDATORY before /plan begins; catches "connective tissue" gaps

code-reuse-analysis:
  description: Check for existing patterns before creating new ones
  phases: [plan]
  triggers:
    phase_gate: plan (Phase 0.7.5)
    keywords:

      - new pattern
      - modify shared code

  phases: [verify]
  triggers:
    phase_gate: implement -> verify (completion)
  note: Feature branch workflow only; mainline just pushes to origin

    ANY spec with ui_changes != none should trigger this skill.
    Also triggers on accessibility keywords even when ui_changes is not set --
    this catches the Phase 5 gap where frontmatter said "none" but the spec
    was entirely about accessibility testing.

    Tier 2/3 items for potential adoption.

# =============================================================================
# ADVISORY ENTRIES (Tier 2/3 — Bryan Framework v3)

    review documents/bryan-framework-v3-adoption-plan.md Tier 2/3 sections
    for components that may be worth adopting for the current work.
