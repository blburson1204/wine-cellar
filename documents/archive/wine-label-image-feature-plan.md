## ✅ Completed: Phase 1A - Display Existing Images

**Implementation Date**: January 4-5, 2026 **Status**: COMPLETE ✅

### What Was Built

1. **Database Schema**
   - Added `imageUrl` field to Wine model
   - Migration created and applied
   - 217 wines populated with existing images

2. **Backend API**
   - GET /api/wines/:id/image endpoint
   - Serves images from assets/wine-labels directory
   - Implements 1-year cache headers for performance
   - Graceful 404 handling for missing images

3. **Frontend Display**
   - Images displayed in Wine Detail modal (view & edit modes)
   - 300px fixed width image on right side
   - Details section on left with flex layout
   - Tasting Notes span full width at bottom
   - Wine emoji 🍷 placeholder with "Image not available" text

### Technical Decisions

- **Image Size**: 300px fixed width in modal (good balance)
- **Placeholder**: Wine emoji 🍷 with explanatory text
- **Thumbnails**: Deferred to Phase 2 (faster MVP delivery)
- **Layout**: Side-by-side design (details left, image right)

### Files Modified

- `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`
- `apps/api/src/app.ts`
- `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/WineDetailModal.tsx`
- `scripts/populate-wine-images.ts` (one-time migration)

## ✅ Completed: Phase 1B - Upload & Edit

**Implementation Date**: January 5-8, 2026 **Status**: COMPLETE ✅

### What Was Built

#### Backend Implementation

1. **Storage Service**

## Database Design

### Current Schema (Phase 1)

```prisma
model Wine {
  id            String    @id @default(cuid())
  name          String
  vintage       Int
  producer      String
  region        String?
  country       String
  grapeVariety  String?
  blendDetail   String?
  color         WineColor
  quantity      Int       @default(1)
  purchasePrice Float?
  purchaseDate  DateTime?
  rating        Float?
  notes         String?

  // Image field (Phase 1)
  imageUrl      String?   // Path to wine label image

  createdAt     DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime  @updatedAt
}
```

### Future Schema (Phase 2 - Thumbnails)

```prisma
model Wine {
  // ... existing fields ...

  imageUrl      String?   // Full-size image
  thumbnailUrl  String?   // Thumbnail (200x200px)

  // ... existing fields ...
}
```

### Future Schema (Phase 4 - Multiple Images)

```prisma
model Wine {
  // ... existing fields ...
  images        WineImage[]
}

model WineImage {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  wineId       String
  wine         Wine     @relation(fields: [wineId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  imageUrl     String
  thumbnailUrl String
  isPrimary    Boolean  @default(false)
  uploadedAt   DateTime @default(now())

  @@index([wineId])
}
```

---

## Storage Strategy

### Current: Local File System (Development)

**Location**: `uploads/wines/{wineId}.jpg`

**Pros**:

- ✅ Simple to implement
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Fast for local development
- ✅ No costs

**Cons**:

- ❌ Not suitable for production deployment
- ❌ Doesn't work with multiple server instances
- ❌ No CDN benefits

### Phase 3: AWS S3 (Production)

**Bucket Structure**:

```
wine-cellar-production/
  wines/
    {wineId}/original.jpg
    {wineId}/thumbnail.jpg
```

**Benefits**:

- Highly scalable and durable
- Works with multiple server instances
- CDN integration via CloudFront
- Automatic backup and versioning
- Pay-as-you-go pricing

**Cost Estimate**:

- S3 Storage: ~$0.023 per GB/month
- Typical usage (100 wines, 1 MB each): ~$0.002/month
- CloudFront: First 1 TB free tier

---

## Image Processing

### Current Implementation

**Library**: Sharp (fast, efficient, well-maintained)

**Processing Pipeline**:

1. Validate file type (magic number check)
2. Resize to max 1200px width (preserves aspect ratio)
3. Compress to 85% JPEG quality
4. Strip EXIF metadata (privacy + size reduction)
5. Convert all formats to JPEG

**Sample Code**:

```typescript
await sharp(buffer)
  .resize(1200, null, {
    fit: 'inside',
    withoutEnlargement: true,
  })
  .jpeg({ quality: 85 })
  .toFile(outputPath);
```

### Future: Thumbnail Generation (Phase 2)

```typescript
await sharp(buffer)
  .resize(200, 200, {
    fit: 'cover',
    position: 'center',
  })
  .jpeg({ quality: 80 })
  .toFile(thumbnailPath);
```

1. ✅ **File Validation**
   - MIME type check
   - Magic number validation (prevents spoofing)
   - File size limit (5 MB max)

2. ✅ **Path Traversal Prevention**
   - Never use user-provided filenames
   - Filenames based on wine ID only

3. ✅ **Error Handling**

## Lessons Learned

1. **Staged Upload Pattern Works Exceptionally Well**
   - Allowing image selection before wine creation dramatically improves UX
   - Users can preview exactly what they're saving
   - Prevents orphaned images

2. **Client + Server Validation is Essential**
   - Double validation catches all edge cases
   - Client validation provides instant feedback
   - Server validation ensures security

3. **Sharp is the Right Choice**
   - Fast, efficient image processing
   - Excellent documentation
   - Wide format support

4. **Local Storage Sufficient for Development**
   - No need to rush to S3
   - Can defer cloud setup until production deployment
   - Keeps development simple and fast

5. **Error Handling is Crucial**
   - Graceful degradation improves reliability
   - Clear error messages help users understand issues
   - Partial success (wine created, image failed) is better than total failure
